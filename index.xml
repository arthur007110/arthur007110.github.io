This project was developed in order to test skills in Angular technology, it is a simple system and in only one page, but it has its complexity in the server of sending emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was developed in 5 days, tested and approved by users, in this system there is a main email created by the developer, which uses the data collected in the system form and an external API to send an email, so that there can be anonymity, there are also some optional tools on the website, such as the reason, which is a set of objects that encapsulate the message and are suggested by the users themselves and approved later by the developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing this project was a lot of fun and resulted in a very concrete learning, in the end it yielded in a very useful system in everyday situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All use of the system is the responsibility of the user and the terms of service must be accepted before using it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The system was developed with the purpose of facilitating the sending of official documents between sectors, called memos, well as facilitating the sending and receiving of such documents. It will already make a good difference to public coffers and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool was developed by four students of the informatics course as their conclusion project, among the frameworks used are present: Node.js, Angular, PrimeNG, Firebase, Nodemailer, Quill, among others, the development of the tool started as a simple project of a web programming discipline but for its potential the tool went ahead, having its production beginning in mid-September 2018 and its completion in December 2019, when it was officially presented to the board of teachers who evaluated it, among the evaluators : Eduardo Wanderlley (Course Coordinator), Carlos Magno, Eugênio Saraiva.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The link for system access is: system-members.web.app was hosted on the firebase servers, nodemailer was deployed on a node.js server and later hosted on a heroku server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the development of this system was developed a great learning among the students involved, not only in the area of ​​programming and knowledge of technologies, but also in how to work in teams, using github.&lt;/p&gt;
